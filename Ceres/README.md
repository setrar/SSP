Soon after the dwarf planet Ceres was discovered in 1801, it was lost. The massive object within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter had traveled behind the sun, but astronomers hadn’t had a chance to calculate its orbit. Enter Johann Carl Friedrich Gauß (or Gauss), who used math to find the lost Ceres and is honored today with a Google Doodle on what would be his 241st birthday.
