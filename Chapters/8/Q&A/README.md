The Fourier Transform Correlation Theorem is a fundamental result that describes the relationship between the time-domain correlation of two signals and their frequency-domain representations through Fourier transforms. The theorem is also known as the Wiener-Khinchin Theorem.

The Fourier Transform Correlation Theorem states that the cross-correlation function of two signals in the time domain is equivalent to the product of their Fourier transforms in the frequency domain. Mathematically, if $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are two signals with Fourier transforms \(X(f)\) and \(Y(f)\), and cross-correlation function \(r_{xy}(\tau)\) is given by:

$r_{xy}(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t)y(t+\tau) \,dt$

Then, the theorem states:

$ r_{xy}(\tau) \longleftrightarrow X^*(f)Y(f) $

Here,
- \(r_{xy}(\tau)\) is the cross-correlation function of \(x(t)\) and \(y(t)\) at time lag \(\tau\).
- \(X^*(f)\) is the complex conjugate of the Fourier transform of \(x(t)\).
- \(Y(f)\) is the Fourier transform of \(y(t)\).

In simpler terms, the theorem tells us that the cross-correlation in the time domain corresponds to the product of the complex conjugates of the Fourier transforms in the frequency domain.

This relationship is particularly useful in signal processing and communication systems, where cross-correlation and convolution operations are prevalent. The Fourier Transform Correlation Theorem provides a convenient way to analyze these operations in the frequency domain, simplifying calculations and providing insights into the behavior of signals.
