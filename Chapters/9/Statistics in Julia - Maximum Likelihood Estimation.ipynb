Because of this gap, I find that many potential Julia users wish there were learning materials that (a) work through solving specific problems in detail rather than through language features in the abstract and (b) discuss best practices for programming in Julia as part of the exposition of solving specific problems. For statistics, this kind of documentation for Julia is, as of April 2020, still largely underdeveloped, and some of what does exist is not freely available online.\n",

My hope is that reading through this notebook and internalizing the main ideas will help bring a user from \"able to write Julia that mostly works\" to \"writing Julia code that is competitive with code written by experts\". To do that, I'll describe how to implement maximum likelihood estimation for the logistic regression model. The final result is not intended to serve as the state of the art implementation of logistic regression for Julia, but, despite that, it should be clear to readers how to make the final implementation competitive with any other implementation in terms of numerical accuracy or execution performance.\n",

Learning to program well requires that one learn a causal mental model about how small changes in code lead to large changes in accuracy or performance; developing such a causal mental model requires that one see many small changes alongside the effects those changes have.\n",

    "Why are we writing this function so that it operates via mutation? Because mutating functions generally have better performance since they make it possible to remove memory allocations from the function body. If we want a pure function, we can write a wrapper for this mutating function that allocates a new arrray for `y`, calls this mutating function and then return the newly allocated `y`.

The `eachindex(y)` function is a popular way to extract indices for arrays in Julia because it can provide the most efficient indexing strategy depending on the type of array you're using, whereas a more straightforward `for i in 1:length(y)` idiom might be sub-optimal for more complex array types like sparse arrays. If you're interested to see more, try running `eachindex` on a 10x10 dense matrix like `rand(10, 10)` versus running it on `SparseArrays.spzeros(10, 10)` from the `SparseArrays` package that's part of Julia's standard library.\n",

We are skipping these checks for the same reason we're mutating our inputs: they can be hoisted out of this part of the code and tested before we enter any loop that invokes this code. We make code like this fast by not doing work we don't have to do, although the result is code that's less safe. In some settings, Julia might be smart enough to remove redundant checks, but we're going to take a bit more control for ourselves.\n",

This principle and the previous principle of starting with a mutating function reflect a broader principle: acknowledge asymmetries in what can be built on top of what. It's easy to build a safe, slower function on top of an unsafe, faster function -- but the reverse is not true. Likewise it's easy to build a pure wrapper that allocates outputs on top of a mutating function, but it's not possible to avoid allocations if your pure function always performs them.\n",
