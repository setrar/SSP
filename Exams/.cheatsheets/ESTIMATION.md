Creating a cheat sheet that contrasts Classical and Bayesian estimation techniques helps clarify the differences in approach and application between these two fundamental statistical methodologies. Here’s a concise overview:

### Classical (Frequentist) Estimation
- **Principle**: Uses sample data to make inferences about population parameters without incorporating prior beliefs.
- **Point Estimators**:
  - Mean ($\bar{x}$)
  - Variance ($s^2$)
  - Proportion ($\hat{p}$)
  - Regression Coefficients ($\hat{\beta}_0$, $\hat{\beta}_1$)
- **Properties**:
  - **Unbiasedness**: Expected value of the estimator equals the true parameter.
  - **Consistency**: Estimator converges to the true parameter as sample size increases.
  - **Efficiency**: Estimator has the smallest variance among all unbiased estimators.
- **Methods**:
  - Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE): Maximizes the likelihood function to estimate parameters.
  - Method of Moments: Equates sample moments with population moments to solve for parameters.

### Bayesian Estimation
- **Principle**: Combines prior knowledge about a parameter with sample data to form a posterior distribution of the parameter.
- **Bayesian Estimators**:
  - Posterior Mean
  - Posterior Median
  - Mode of the Posterior Distribution (Maximum a Posteriori, MAP)
- **Properties**:
  - **Incorporates Prior Information**: Uses a prior distribution that reflects previous knowledge or belief about a parameter.
  - **Posterior Distribution**: Provides a full probability distribution of the parameter, reflecting uncertainty.
- **Methods**:
  - Bayes’ Theorem: Updates the probability estimate for a hypothesis as additional evidence is acquired.
  - Numerical/Simulation Methods: Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC), especially for complex models.
- **Key Formulas**:
  - **Bayes' Theorem for Parameter $\theta$**: 
    $P(\theta|data) = \frac{P(data|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(data)}$
    Where $P(\theta|data)$ is the posterior distribution, $P(data|\theta)$ is the likelihood of observing the data given $\theta$, $P(\theta)$ is the prior distribution, and $P(data)$ is the evidence or marginal likelihood of the data.

### Comparative Insights:
- **Prior Information**: Classical estimation does not incorporate prior information, while Bayesian estimation does.
- **Interpretation of Probability**:
  - Classical: Long-run frequency of outcomes.
  - Bayesian: Degree of belief or certainty about outcomes.
- **Uncertainty Representation**:
  - Classical: Through confidence intervals and p-values.
  - Bayesian: Through the posterior distribution.

### Application Contexts:
- **Classical Estimation**: Preferred in settings where a long-run frequency interpretation is appropriate or when prior information is not available or not desired to be included.
- **Bayesian Estimation**: Useful when prior knowledge is available or when a more comprehensive uncertainty quantification is needed. Ideal for updating estimates with new information.

This cheat sheet succinctly delineates the foundational differences and applications of Classical and Bayesian estimation methods, providing a quick reference for students and practitioners in statistics and data science.
